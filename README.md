# OTD Photo Gallery Plugin for Obsidian

Automatically generate a photo gallery inside your daily notes using a simple code block.

This plugin scans a dated photo folder and builds an image grid based on the date of the note‚Äîperfect for journaling, "on this day" reflections, and visual life-logging.

---

## üì¶ How to Use

Insert this code block into your note:

````markdown
```OTD-Photo
usefilename=true
fallbacktotoday=true
columns=3
style=horizontal
```
````

> üìù **Make sure your note is named like `YYYY-MM-DD.md`** for best results.

The plugin will automatically:
- Extract the date from the filename
- Look inside `Journal_Photos/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Display a grid of image thumbnails
- Open images in Obsidian when clicked
- Create the folder if it doesn‚Äôt already exist

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

| Option           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## üñº Example

```
They will be rendered in a clean, clickable grid.
